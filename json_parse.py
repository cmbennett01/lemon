    """ Encapsulate the quality of a set of photometric parameters.

    How do we determine how good a set of parameters for aperture photometry
    is? In order to compare them, we need to identify the most constant stars
    (or, by extension, any other astronomical object) in the field and compute
    their light curves. The better the aperture, annulus and dannulus that we
    use are, the lower the standard deviation of the resulting curves.

    This class simply encapsulates these four values, mapping the parameters
    for aperture photometry (aperture, annulus and dannulus) to the standard
    deviation of the light curves of the most constant astronomical objects.

    Fields:
    aperture - the aperture radius, in pixels.
    annulus - the inner radius of the sky annulus, in pixels.
    dannulus - the width of the sky annulus, in pixels.
    stdev - the median, arithmetic mean or a similar statistical measure of the
            standard deviation of the light curves of the astronomical objects
            when photometry is done using these aperture, annulus and dannulus
            values.

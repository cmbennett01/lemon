desc['ncores'] = \
"the maximum number of cores available to the module. This option " \
"defaults to the number of CPUs in the system, which are automatically " \
"detected [default: %default]"

maximum = 50000
desc['maximum'] = \
"the CCD saturation level, in ADUs. Those star which have one or more " \
"pixels above this value are considered to be saturated. Note that, for " \
"coadded images, the effective saturation level is obtained by multiplying " \
"this value by the number of coadds (see --coaddk option) [default: %default]"

margin = 0
desc['margin'] = \
"the width, in pixels, of the areas adjacent to the edges that will be " \
"ignored when detecting sources on the reference image. Stars whose center " \
"is fewer than 'margin' pixels from any border (horizontal or vertical) of " \
"the FITS image are not considered. [default: %default]"

verbosity = 0
desc['verbosity'] = \
"increase the amount of information given during the execution. A single " \
"-v tracks INFO events, while two or more enable DEBUG messages. These " \
"are probably only useful when debugging the module."

desc['snr_percentile'] = \
"the score at the percentile of the signal-to-noise ratio of the " \
"astronomical objects that are to be included in the calculation of the " \
"FWHM / elongation of a FITS image. Objects whose SNR is below this " \
"score are excluded. Note that the percentile is calculated taking into " \
"account only the astronomical objects within the image margins (see " \
"the '--margin' option) [default: %default]"

desc['mean'] = \
"in order to compute the FWHM / elongation of a FITS image, take the " \
"arithmetic mean of the astronomical objects (detected by SExtractor) " \
"instead of the median. So you say you prefer a non-robust statistic?"

desc['filter'] = \
"The supported systems are Johnson, Cousins, Gunn, SDSS, 2MASS, Stromgren " \
"and H-alpha, but letters, designating a particular section of the " \
"electromagnetic spectrum, may also be used without a system (e.g., 'V'). " \
"In addition to the built-in photometric systems, custom filters are " \
"supported via the %s configuration file." % setup.CONFIG_FILENAME

    By design, all GTK events (including window refreshing and updates) are

    the application or callback code is running [1]. This means that nothing
    will happen in the application windows unless we explicitly tell GTK to
    process any events that have been left pending. This is what this context
    manager does, running any pending iteration of the main loop immediately
    before and after the 'with' block.

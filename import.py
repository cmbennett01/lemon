description = """
The purpose of this module, the first of the LEMON pipeline, is to
automatically detect all the FITS files belonging to an observation campaign
and save them to another directory. This is particularly needed when reducing
images taken at observatories that enforce specific naming conventions, such as
using a different directory for each night. In situations like that, the
astronomer may easily end up with hundreds of images scattered over dozens of
directories, many times also with duplicate filenames. As if, for example, the
first image of the night must be named 'ferM_0001.fits' and so on, there will
be _many_ files with that name, this script may be used in order to
sequentially rename all the images.

What this script does, in short, is to: (a) automatically detect all the FITS
files within a directory tree, (b) discard those saturated (i.e., whose median
number of ADUs is above a certain threshold) or whose keyword with the name for
the object observed does not match any of the given patterns, such as 'bias',
'skyflat*' or 'ngc2264*', (c) sort them by their date of observation and,
finally, (d) copy them to the output directory, renaming them
sequentially. Some statistics on the imported FITS files are shown to the user
before the script exits. It is enforced that all the imported images have the
same size: in case there are multiple dimensions among the detected FITS
images, only those with the most common size will be imported, while the others
will be ignored.
